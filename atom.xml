    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Really a brilliant collection of insights and strong thoughts around
feminism and it's connections to all aspects of society and life. The
book is short but somehow packed with some much knowledge and beautiful
connections to other works and writers/thinkers. Lola is a genius,
really, of explaining practical ways to engage with feminism, and what
it means for how we can engage it to bring about change. If you're ever
at a loss for words when someone asks you "What is feminism?" then this
book is for you!</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Really quite interesting and good. I think I'd seen Fern Brady
before, and she's clearly and interesting person, but this an
enlightening book for me, in particular in building some empathy for how
people with autism experience life and their emotions, and in particular
women. Great reading!</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've got mixed feelings about this book. Mostly, it was good; it was informative and I learned a lot. The graphic novel form is also just a nice way to convey a complicated topic with lots of personal feeling and information. On the other hand, I can't say I found the author totally likeable; but perhaps that just means she presented her story truly; after all, we all make mistakes and say things we regret. In any case, I'm glad I read this, and if you're at all curious about a personal perspective on Iran, I at least found it interesting and worthwhile.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I quite liked this. It's a nice discussion of climate activism and the general connection between activism and resistance. It leaves a lot of food for thought about what is necessary in order to make people change their behaviours. A great, short, thoughtful, and inspiring read.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just simply an extremely enjoyable and engaging read about life in a bookshop :) I loved it; I've been reading a few of these "real-life bookshop" stories, to get a sense of what it might be like to work in one, and I think this story is particularly interesting because of the history associated with this particular bookshop, and of course the author is just a great story teller. Highly recommended if you want to get a sense of the magic that it could be, to work in a rare bookshop!</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This book will always have a special place in my heart now, given that it happened to be the book I was reading at the time our daughter arrived, and as a result I finished it by reading it to her in her first few days of being out and about :) That said, on it's own merit it is pretty good. I learned some interesting facts about glaciers; enjoyed learning about her life, and overall got inspired about this kind of career. Pretty good!</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A fairly strange but reasonably interesting story. I think in the end I liked it; perhaps I was hoping for a bit more of a feeling of "mysterious train journey", but what I got was more "confusing train journey"; but, I did find the ending worth-while; so I don't regret my time reading it. Worth picking up :)</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This book wasn't what I expected, but it was still quite interesting. It's seems to be me to be roughly a biography of this persons life in the social sector, but is also an exploration of a whole bunch of "alternative" programs that focus the particular communities, marginalised groups, and aim to find solutions from <em>within</em> those groups, rather than "fixing" them from the outside, with metrics and impact reports, etc. I think it's a great source of inspiration on that front, and has some relevance <a href="https://fixplanet.club/">for a project I'm part of</a> in the climate space. Definitely worth a glance!</p>]]></summary>

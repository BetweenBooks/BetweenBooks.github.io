    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a strange one. I didn't know anything about this person or
service, and I was expecting the book to be mostly funny. But it was
actually far more serious and thoughtful than I had anticipated. I
probably wouldn't recommend it to everyone; but it's at least refreshing
for it's alternative take on what it means to live and relate to people.
I also found it, I think, to be an interesting insight into some parts
of modern Japanese culture. Quirky, for sure.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Extremely readable and enjoyable. Booth managed to write in such a
way that the atmosphere of the journey and the places was very well
conveyed. Made me want to be there! Just some really nice story-telling.
Highly recommended :)</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazing reading, ideas, and suggested actions for wildly revising how
food is produced. I found this book particularly relevant because I have
just started a new job that is in this space; but even otherwise it is a
great, non-judgemental, and surprisingly inspiring, book about the
climate crisis. It may even inspire you to start gardening :)</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Absolutely extraordinary book. Extremely informative, powerful,
emotional, inspiring, and poetic. I was struck at first by the amazing
writing (which comes across really well in translation, I think, not
that I've read the original ...), but stayed for the amazing
story-telling and information about various illegal practices in
Brazil.</p>
<p>It's really an impressive piece of work, I can highly recommend it,
but do note that it is also, in parts, quite traumatic. Still; one of
those books that you feel sad when it ends; well worth reading!</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An enjoyably rich read. I can't quite say what I got out of this
other than simply the joy of reading. One thing I know for sure is that
Egan is an amazing writer. I was reading this and another book, at the
same time, and it was just incomparable how good her writing was ... in
comparision :D. One memorable moment is that I read a lot of this book
aloud, and the part where she writes as a teenager is just, for my mind,
absolutely spot on. Anyway; highly recommend this one for some relaxing
reading!</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I liked this book. It discusses what seem to be some quite reasonable
approaches for dealing with children. It's a bit too early for me to put
in to practice, but a lot of the discussions seem quite good, and it'll
probably be something I refer back to in a few years :)</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I picked this up after watching and enjoying the show. The book is
quite different; and it's interesting actually to compare it with the
show; the team that converted the book into the show have done an
impressive job, I think! I like both. I really couldn't put the book
down. It has compellingly written and just interesting. A great read for
those interested in the workings of organised crime (and journalism!) in
Japan. I loved it!</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not bad; just not mind-blowing like the rest of her work. She's set
an extremely high bar for her work, and while this series is good for
anyone else, for me it was just a bit lacking the brilliance of her
earlier ones. But it's a bit of an unfair comparision. Her first few
books were, for me, just absolutely amazing, and this series didn't
quite compare. It's still good, and worth reading all the way to the end
of the acknowledgements for an alternative title. But if you were
compelled to read only one of her works, you would start with literally
any other series.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Really a brilliant collection of insights and strong thoughts around
feminism and it's connections to all aspects of society and life. The
book is short but somehow packed with some much knowledge and beautiful
connections to other works and writers/thinkers. Lola is a genius,
really, of explaining practical ways to engage with feminism, and what
it means for how we can engage it to bring about change. If you're ever
at a loss for words when someone asks you "What is feminism?" then this
book is for you!</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Really quite interesting and good. I think I'd seen Fern Brady
before, and she's clearly and interesting person, but this an
enlightening book for me, in particular in building some empathy for how
people with autism experience life and their emotions, and in particular
women. Great reading!</p>]]></summary>

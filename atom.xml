    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was interesting and sad, truthfully. I've read a few of these
"high-profile female celebrity" life books, and the common theme is just
how much of a "normal" life they want, and how people around them betray
them. I also think it's such a shame for people who's professional dream
just happens to be one which makes them famous (not something that is
likely to happen to me!), and then they suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Of course there is also the story of the conservatorship, which
personally I can't begin to understand how it's legal.</p>
<p>Overall, a very interesting and worthwhile read, and just a reminder,
for me, of the importance of building self-empowerment in all children,
and just the appreciation for a caring and supportive upbringing that I
have had.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I learned a lot from this book. I quite enjoyed how it covered a
variety of experiences of people from the Sherpa community, and it seems
to me that it did a pretty fair job. It's certainly interesting to see
how the Sherpa's view climbing. Worth a read for the stories and if
you're interested in climbing culture and how and why the Sherpa's
participate.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Really an exceptional piece of writing. A friend bought this for me,
and at the time I didn't realise I had already read another of her
books. This one is of a totally different character; basically telling
the story of a woman's engagement with pregnancy, and the way society
encourages it be handled. Being myself now a partner and a witness to
this, I found it a very interesting perspective and helped me relate to
the birth parent more. It's a stressful read, but an amazing one I
think. Highly recommended!</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I quite enjoyed this book; but it's probably not for everyone. Losada
has an engaging and friendly style; extremely readable and enjoyable.
The way she engages with the topic is pretty generous I think; perhaps
the main criticism is that it's occasionally a bit too optimistic; but
after all, that's basically what it promises on the cover! Overall, if
you're looking for a bit of optimism and happiness, then take a glance!
I'll definitely be trying to read more of her books :)</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I picked this up because I've quite enjoyed his other books. This one
was also pretty good; certainly compelling and readable. That said, it
doesn't particularly challenge ideas about borders or immigration in any
way that I would find agreeable. There's no doubt Keefe is a great
story-teller, and I did enjoy reading this one, but you could be
forgiven for passing it up for something else. That said, it did at
least highlight to me <em>some</em> of the challenges building an
effective immigration policy.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a strange one. I didn't know anything about this person or
service, and I was expecting the book to be mostly funny. But it was
actually far more serious and thoughtful than I had anticipated. I
probably wouldn't recommend it to everyone; but it's at least refreshing
for it's alternative take on what it means to live and relate to people.
I also found it, I think, to be an interesting insight into some parts
of modern Japanese culture. Quirky, for sure, a little depressing, even,
but a worthwhile read nevertheless.</p>]]></summary>

way that the atmosphere of the journey and the places was very well
conveyed. Made me want to be there! Just some really nice story-telling.
Highly recommended :)</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazing reading, ideas, and suggested actions for wildly revising how
food is produced. I found this book particularly relevant because I have
just started a new job that is in this space; but even otherwise it is a
great, non-judgemental, and surprisingly inspiring, book about the
climate crisis. It may even inspire you to start gardening :)</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Absolutely extraordinary book. Extremely informative, powerful,
emotional, inspiring, and poetic. I was struck at first by the amazing
writing (which comes across really well in translation, I think, not
that I've read the original ...), but stayed for the amazing
story-telling and information about various illegal practices in
Brazil.</p>
<p>It's really an impressive piece of work, I can highly recommend it,
but do note that it is also, in parts, quite traumatic. Still; one of
those books that you feel sad when it ends; well worth reading!</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An enjoyably rich read. I can't quite say what I got out of this
other than simply the joy of reading. One thing I know for sure is that
Egan is an amazing writer. I was reading this and another book, at the
same time, and it was just incomparable how good her writing was ... in
comparision :D. One memorable moment is that I read a lot of this book
aloud, and the part where she writes as a teenager is just, for my mind,
absolutely spot on. Anyway; highly recommend this one for some relaxing
reading!</p>]]></summary>

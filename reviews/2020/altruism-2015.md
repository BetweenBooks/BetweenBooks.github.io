summary: >
  An exploration into compassion, kindness, empathy, innate goodness and how
  these concepts relate to the idea of being altruistic. Comes from a buddhist
  point of view, but has a very broad approach and generally-applicable advice
  and thoughts. Particularly good comments around the idea of emotional
  burn-out and (Buddhist) techniques for managing it.

Important concepts:

- Difference between empathy and compassion

Quoted Quotes:

- Jean-Jacques Rousseau: "The rich man has little compassion for the poor man,
  since he can't imagine himself poor".
- Alexandre Jollien: "In pity, sadness comes first. I am sad that the other is
suffering, but I don't really love them. In compassion, love comes first."

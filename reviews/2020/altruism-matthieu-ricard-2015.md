summary:
  An exploration into compassion, kindness, empathy, innate goodness and how
  these concepts relate to the idea of being altruistic. Comes from a buddhist
  point of view, but has a very broad approach and generally-applicable advice
  and thoughts. Particularly good comments around the idea of emotional
  burn-out and (Buddhist) techniques for managing it.

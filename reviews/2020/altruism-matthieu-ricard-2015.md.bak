summary:
  An exploration into compassion, kindness, empathy, innate goodness and how
  these concepts relate to the idea of being altruistic. Comes from a buddhist
  point of view, but has a very broad approach and generally-applicable advice
  and thoughts. Particularly good comments around the idea of emotional
  burn-out and (Buddhist) techniques for managing it.

#### Rough Summary

A big collection of research and arguments around a bunch of concepts in ethics and
altruism. Nicely presented and probably pretty-well researched; but I think
not perfect.

I found it pretty good; but it is a long read. The things I got out of it the
most are:

- Difference between empathy and compassion, and how compassion helps prevent
empathetic burnout,
- Arguments about why we're not inherently selfish,
- Neat ideas for how to help children learn altruism.

I think it's probably a good book to come and to when having doubts and for
reminding yourself of useful arguments about how people are essentially good.


#### Specific Notes

<span class="ch">I. What Is Altruism?</span>

- Page 34 - Jean-Jacques Rousseau:

  > "The rich man has little compassion for the poor man,
  > since he can't imagine himself poor".

- Page 51 - Alexandre Jollien: 

  > "In pity, sadness comes first. I am sad that the other is
  > suffering, but I don't really love them. In compassion, love comes first."

- Page 69

  > Uri Hasson thinks that this "brain coupling" is essential to
  > communication.

  I think I liked this part because it reminded me of ideas in [I Am A Strange
  Loop](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123471.I_Am_a_Strange_Loop) in the
  sense of a meeting of minds being kind of like having a "copy" of that
  person in your person; which naturally makes it easier to communicate!

- Page 78 - Discussion around the idea of whether or not it's altruistic if you
benefit from the action. The claim is that it's okay, as long as it's not the
_intent_ to benefit. This is a common theme: the intent matters.

- Page 84 - Nice quote re: Politics

  > Philosopher Andre comte-Sponville expresses it this way: "I think that the
  > whole art of politics is to make selfish individuals more intelligent,
  > which I call 'solidarity' and which Jacques Attali calls 'self-interested
  > alutrism.' It is a question of making people understand that it is in
  > their own self-interest to take into account the interests of others."


<span class="ch">II. The Emergence of Alutrism</span>

- Page 147 - On cultivating compassion

  > ... We can find an inspiration in these words attribute to an old Cherokee
  > giving advice to his grandson: "A fight is going on inside me," he said to
  > the boy. "It is a terrible fight between two wolves. One is evil &mdash; he is
  > hatred, anger, greed, envy, arrogance, grudge, resentment, miserliness,
  > cowardliness. The other is good &mdash; he is happiness, joy, serenity,
  > love, kindness, compassion, hope, humility, geneorisity, truthfulness, and
  > confidence. They are also fighting inside you and inside every other
  > person, too." The child thought about it for a minute and then asked his
  > grandfather, "Which wolf will win?" The old Cherokee simply replied, "The
  > one you feed."

awareness, guilt is not.a

<span class="ch">IV. Contrary Forces</span>

- Page 275 - Comments on Ego and the centeredness of **I**; i.e. how much
time and attention we give to it, and how it relates to buddhist ideas of
interconnectedness.

- Page 313 - On freedom and being free to "do whatever you want":

  > In practice, expressing oneself free of any constraints seems more destined
  > to hinder the good of society than to accomplish it. I met a young
  > American woman who told me, "To be really myself, to be free, I have to be
  > faithful to what I feel, and spontaneously express whatever I like and
  > whatever suits me". True freedom, however, does not consist in doing
  > whatever comes to mind, but in being master on oneself.

  This was a nice comment I thought, as I certainly typically feel that to be
  free is do to whatever you want; but here he argues for taking even greater
  control of yourself by using meditation to become aware of how feelings and
  the environment influence us. Interesting.

- Page 320 - Discussion of self-compassion over self-esteem. Quote from
Kristin Neff:

  > One reason that self-compassion may be more beneficial than self-esteem is
  > that it tends to be available precisely when self-esteem fails. Personal
  > flaws and shortcomings can be approached in a kind and balanced manner
  > that recognizes that imperfection is part of the human condition, even
  > when self-evaluations are negative. This means that self-compassion can
  > lessen feelings of self-loathing without requiring that one adopt an
  > unrealistically positive view of oneself &mdash; a major reason why
  > self-esteem enhancement programs often fail.

fighting each other.

<span class="ch">V. Building a More Altruistic Society</span>

- Page 534 and friends - Discussion of moral neutrality in education; i.e. maybe we
shouldn't teach a specific religion, but certainly it's a good idea to teach
kindness, tolerance and an ability to understand your emotions. Some
discussion of interesting programs in schools that had interesting results.
Good to refer back to when thinking about teaching classes.

- Page 539 - Regarding Cognitive Based Compassion Therapy in children.

  > This program lasts eight weeks and comprises:
  > 1. developing attention and stability of mind;
  > 2. observing the inner nature of thoughts, feelings and emotions;
  > 3. exploring self-compassion &mdash; recognizing our desire for happiness,
  >    the mental states that lead to personal fulfillment, and willingness to
  >    free onself from emotional states that detract from happiness;
  > 4. developing impartiality towards other beings, be they friends, enemies,
  >    or strangers, and at the same time questioning the value &mdash; fixed,
  >    or superficial and changing &mdash; of this categorization, and
  >    identifying a shared desire in everyone to be happy and to avoid
  >    suffering;
  > 5. developing gratitude toward others, with no one able to survive without
  >    the support of countless and other people;
  > 6. developing benevolence and empathy;
  > 7. developing compassion for those who are suffering, and a desire that
  >    they be freed from that suffering;
  > 8. implementing altruism into everyday life.

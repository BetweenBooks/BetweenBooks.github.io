    <h1>Altruism: The Power of Compassion to Change Yourself and the World</h1>

    <div class="summary">
      <p><p>An exploration into compassion, kindness, empathy, innate goodness and how these concepts relate to the idea of being altruistic. Comes from a Buddhist point of view, but has a very broad approach and generally-applicable advice and thoughts. Particularly good comments around the idea of emotional burn-out and (Buddhist) techniques for managing it.</p></p>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <h4 id="rough-summary">Rough Summary</h4>
<p>A big collection of research and arguments around a bunch of concepts in ethics and
altruism. Nicely presented and probably pretty-well researched; but I think
not perfect.</p>
<p>I found it pretty good; but it is a long read. The things I got out of it the
most are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difference between empathy and compassion, and how compassion helps prevent
empathetic burnout,</li>
<li>Arguments about why we’re not inherently selfish,</li>
<li>Neat ideas for how to help children learn altruism.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it’s probably a good book to come and to when having doubts and for
reminding yourself of useful arguments about how people are essentially good.</p>
<h4 id="specific-notes">Specific Notes</h4>
<p><span class="ch">I. What Is Altruism?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Page 34 - Jean-Jacques Rousseau:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The rich man has little compassion for the poor man,
since he can’t imagine himself poor”.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Page 51 - Alexandre Jollien:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In pity, sadness comes first. I am sad that the other is
suffering, but I don’t really love them. In compassion, love comes first.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Page 69</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uri Hasson thinks that this “brain coupling” is essential to
communication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I liked this part because it reminded me of ideas in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123471.I_Am_a_Strange_Loop">I Am A Strange
Loop</a> in the
sense of a meeting of minds being kind of like having a “copy” of that
person in your person; which naturally makes it easier to communicate!</p></li>
<li><p>Page 78 - Discussion around the idea of whether or not it’s altruistic if you
benefit from the action. The claim is that it’s okay, as long as it’s not the
<em>intent</em> to benefit. This is a common theme: the intent matters.</p></li>
<li><p>Page 84 - Nice quote re: Politics</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Philosopher Andre comte-Sponville expresses it this way: “I think that the
whole art of politics is to make selfish individuals more intelligent,
which I call ‘solidarity’ and which Jacques Attali calls ‘self-interested
altruism.’ It is a question of making people understand that it is in
their own self-interest to take into account the interests of others.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="ch">II. The Emergence of Altruism</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Page 147 - On cultivating compassion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… We can find an inspiration in these words attribute to an old Cherokee
giving advice to his grandson: “A fight is going on inside me,” he said to
the boy. “It is a terrible fight between two wolves. One is evil — he is
hatred, anger, greed, envy, arrogance, grudge, resentment, miserliness,
cowardliness. The other is good — he is happiness, joy, serenity,
love, kindness, compassion, hope, humility, generosity, truthfulness, and
confidence. They are also fighting inside you and inside every other
person, too.” The child thought about it for a minute and then asked his
grandfather, “Which wolf will win?” The old Cherokee simply replied, “The
one you feed.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Page 198 - Regarding theory of mind in birds.</p></li>
<li><p>Page 219</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research shows unanimously that the most constructive and effective
attitude consists of calmly explaining to the child why it would be better
for him to change his behaviour. It’s the approach that Hoffman calls
<strong>induction</strong>. The child is urged to adopt the perspective of the other
and especially to realise the harm he may have caused to the other. The
child is also shown how to spot the harm that has been committed.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Page 220 - Regret vs Guilt: Regret can be constructive in terms of
awareness, guilt is not.a</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Page 254 - Epigenetic changes via meditation.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="ch">IV. Contrary Forces</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Page 275 - Comments on Ego and the centeredness of <strong>I</strong>; i.e. how much
time and attention we give to it, and how it relates to Buddhist ideas of
interconnectedness.</p></li>
<li><p>Page 313 - On freedom and being free to “do whatever you want”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In practice, expressing oneself free of any constraints seems more destined
to hinder the good of society than to accomplish it. I met a young
American woman who told me, “To be really myself, to be free, I have to be
faithful to what I feel, and spontaneously express whatever I like and
whatever suits me”. True freedom, however, does not consist in doing
whatever comes to mind, but in being master on oneself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a nice comment I thought, as I certainly typically feel that to be
free is do to whatever you want; but here he argues for taking even greater
control of yourself by using meditation to become aware of how feelings and
the environment influence us. Interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>Page 320 - Discussion of self-compassion over self-esteem. Quote from
Kristin Neff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One reason that self-compassion may be more beneficial than self-esteem is
that it tends to be available precisely when self-esteem fails. Personal
flaws and shortcomings can be approached in a kind and balanced manner
that recognizes that imperfection is part of the human condition, even
when self-evaluations are negative. This means that self-compassion can
lessen feelings of self-loathing without requiring that one adopt an
unrealistically positive view of oneself — a major reason why
self-esteem enhancement programs often fail.</p>

fighting each other.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Page 534 and friends - Discussion of moral neutrality in education; i.e. maybe we
shouldn’t teach a specific religion, but certainly it’s a good idea to teach
kindness, tolerance and an ability to understand your emotions. Some
discussion of interesting programs in schools that had interesting results.
Good to refer back to when thinking about teaching classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Page 539 - Regarding Cognitive Based Compassion Therapy in children.</p>
<blockquote>
This program lasts eight weeks and comprises:
<ol type="1">
<li>developing attention and stability of mind;</li>
<li>observing the inner nature of thoughts, feelings and emotions;</li>
<li>exploring self-compassion — recognizing our desire for happiness,
the mental states that lead to personal fulfillment, and willingness to
free oneself from emotional states that detract from happiness;</li>
<li>developing impartiality towards other beings, be they friends, enemies,
or strangers, and at the same time questioning the value — fixed,
or superficial and changing — of this categorization, and
identifying a shared desire in everyone to be happy and to avoid
suffering;</li>
<li>developing gratitude toward others, with no one able to survive without
the support of countless and other people;</li>
<li>developing benevolence and empathy;</li>
<li>developing compassion for those who are suffering, and a desire that
they be freed from that suffering;</li>
<li>implementing altruism into everyday life.</li>
</ol>
<p>Children are very receptive to this sort of education. When one of the
instructors compared anger to a spark in a forest, which at the start can
easily be extinguished but which rapidly becomes a huge, destructive,
out-of-control inferno, a little five-year-old girl said: “There are a lot
of forest fires in my life.”</p>

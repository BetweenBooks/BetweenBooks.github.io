summary: | 
  This is a very legitimate and intense book, with a strong American
  focus. It argues that the police are actively harmful, and points out
  all sorts of issues with "improvement" programs, and more generally the
  structure that supports the policing apparatus. I went in to this book
  probably being open-minded; I would've argued, before reading it, that
  police are generally good and useful, but of course that comes from my
  perspective as a white man. I see now the other perspective, and while
  I'm not fully convinced by all the examples in this book; I do think
  that in general, the message of using communities and local-supporting
  systems over the state-managed "violence workers", is certainly
  attractive. While this book does have *some* practical ideas for how
  communities can self-organise in this way, I would've liked to see more.
  But I suppose this idea is just developing, and this was my first
  entrypoint into this kind of thinking. Overall, I do recommend this
  book; I think it's very passionately written and contains a lot of good
  arguments. But it's also quite confronting, so be prepared!

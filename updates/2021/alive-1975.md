summary:
  <p>An amazing story and great reading. I picked up this particular
  second-hand copy in Hay-on-Wye, a self-proclaimed "Book Town", and in it
  we found a photo of someone, probably the loved-one of a previous
  reader! The book itself is highly readable; in fact I could barely put
  it down and read it in just two days!</p>

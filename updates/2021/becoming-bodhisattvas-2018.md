summary: | 
  Just an amazing book. Basically, it's about how to apply Buddhist-style
  thoughts to your life and actions more generally, with a particular view
  to trying to "reduce suffering" of those around you. Pema Chödrön is
  really just a great writer, and has a really accessible interpretation
  of "The Way of the Boddhisattvas". I personally got a lot of inspiration
  and encouragement from this book; and while I might not agree with
  absolutely everything, there's plenty in here to like and explore.

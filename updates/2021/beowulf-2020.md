summary: 
  I loved this. I've never read Beowulf before, and am very very happy
  this is translation was the first. Highly readable, with very fun and
  enjoyable language, and some nice comments from the author at the start.
  I'll definitely be reading this again, and am now keen to read more
  books by her! Highly recommended.

summary: 
  I really loved this book. I think it's interesting for a few reasons.
  One is that I haven't read many books where an autistic person is
  describing their feelings and experiences. It's really interesting to
  learn. Another part that really impacted me was his discussion of how
  young people are being forced to be more active and outspoken, but,
  ultimately, are excluded from important decision making, and that adults
  praise them, but inevitably continue doing whatever they were doing
  before. That comment hit me quite strongly, and I'm not sure what to do
  about it yet. Overall, an exceptional read, and will help you appreciate
  nature!

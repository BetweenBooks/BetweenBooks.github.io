summary: 
  I found this book very interesting. One concept it introduced to me was
  the idea of "solidarity" instead of "support", in social causes. She
  makes the argument that it's better to stand in "solidarity" with one
  other, and for "me" to "support" you. Her argument, in part, is because
  relationships don't work strictly one-directionally. This spoke to me a
  lot. The bulk of the book is concerned with looking at how
  "counter-publics" - places where the public can be involved politically,
  but not necessarily supported by the government - work, examples of
  them, and how we can and should embrace them. I really like it; but it
  might be a bit "theory"-dense for some. Recommended reading, though, if
  you're interested in how people are being politically-active and how
  feminism should sit at the center of anti-fascism; also particularly
  interesting to get a Polish perspective on this idea; as it's not one
  I've heard before.

summary:
  <p>An interesting discussion around how cities are not constructed for the
  enjoyment of <i>everyone</i>, and are gendered in various ways. Also raises
  some interesting arguments around how hard it is to balance privileging
  different groups when deciding on improvements to urban infrastructure.
  Overall, I was left a bit unsatisfied and was hoping for a bit more
  exploration of some possible answers; but certainly would still
  recommend it to get motivated and understand the space of problems to
  solve!</p>

summary: | 
  For me there's really no better book on what it means to be conscious
  and how to think about consciousness. As always, I like books that
  connect back to Buddhism in some what, and I found that this one really
  does; even though I don't think the author makes that connection
  explicitly. In any case, if you're interested in quite a different
  perspective on how to think of personhood and what makes you you, I
  really recommend this book!

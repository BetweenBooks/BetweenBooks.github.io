summary: 
  This books wasn't what I thought it would be. I admit I thought it was
  going to be about some kind of adventure in Antarctica; but in fact it's
  a novel about a stroke. I found it very very stressful for read, but I
  think that's the intention. To some degree I think it managed to convey
  the difficulties with having a stroke, and the impact on people around
  you. But mostly I was stressed because of how I felt the characters
  would be feeling, and because I think I could get a raw feeling of how
  it would be if *I* had a stroke, and that caused me a lot of anxiety.
  Probably an interesting book for some, but not one that I would read
  again in a hurry.

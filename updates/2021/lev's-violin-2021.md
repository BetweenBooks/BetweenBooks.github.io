summary: 
  This book was enjoyable, easy, reading. I got fully immersed in the
  feeling of the violin culture; in the history and the way the author is
  follows the story through different towns and countries. This idea of
  just taking a journey dictated entirely by a spontaneous interest is
  very appealing. Really enjoyed it!

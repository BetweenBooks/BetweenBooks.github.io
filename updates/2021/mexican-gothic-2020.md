summary: 
  I picked this book in part because my partner is Mexican, and I was
  curious to see what kind of Mexican culture would be included in a book
  like this One aspect that I found interesting was how Mexican culture
  relates to ghosts. I found this book a nice, simple, and compelling
  read.

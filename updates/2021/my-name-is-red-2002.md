summary: 
  This was a bit of a long read that took me a while to get into, but I
  did get their eventually. I certainly found it had some nice thoughts,
  but I found parts of the book to be oddly unnecessary. As a
  murder-mystery I can't say I enjoyed it (maybe because I didn't guess
  who the killer would be...) because I found all the voices to be a bit
  same-y; but maybe that was poor reading on my part. I think I'd probably
  recommend this book, and do agree with the essence of the assessments on
  the front. Worth reading just for the quirky telling.

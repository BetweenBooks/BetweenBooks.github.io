summary: |
  Another amazing book by a refugee who was imprisoned at the time. It is
  about his experience in the prison; something that had been totally
  covered up by the Australian government. At the time the book was
  published he was <i>still</i> in prison! It's exceptionally readable,
  interesting and engaging, but it does have some quite traumatic
  sections. It's has a beautifully written style interspersed with
  sections of poetry. You will certainly leave with very strong feelings
  for what people like this have been put through by our governments. I
  really gained a lot from reading it.

summary: | 
  This was interesting reading, but probably overall not quite my kind of
  thing. I found the style quite stressful; but I do think that was the
  intention. The idea, I suppose, is to convey the chaoticness of reading
  Twitter every second; and constant changing of attention. But this is
  something that I personally find a bit stressful, and this was conveyed
  very accurately through the writing. I do think it had some nice jokes,
  and variously interesting bits of social commentary; and, as one review
  I listened to, clearly this author is very familiar with social media.
  But it's not one I'll likely read again. Might be of interest to those
  who want another perspective on what engagement with social media can
  look like!

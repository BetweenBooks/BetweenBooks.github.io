summary: |
  <p>Written by Thich Nhat Hanh, of "How To Walk, How To Love, How To Eat,
  ..." fame, this is quite a large book but nevertheless, very engaging.
  Consisting of several stories related to the life of the "historical"
  Buddha. I think this book is a particularly good entrypoint to this
  particular variant of Buddhist writing: namely stories that have a bit
  of magical character, but also attempt to be somewhat historical
  accuracy. One thing I found particularly interesting was to learn that
  early Buddhism, in this telling, was quite sexist. I really appreciated
  this detail being included; it helped me see that Buddhism, much like
  any approach, isn't perfect and needs a process of self-correction;
  which in my interpretation it does have. Overall, I loved this book.
  It's simple, easy, reading, has some nice messages and stories. But it's
  certainly not full of practical advice for mindfulness, but if you're
  keen on that you can you can check out the authors many other offerings!</p>

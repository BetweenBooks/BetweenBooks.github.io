summary: 
  I love James Acasters comedy; his show
  [Repertoire](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80213803) is one of the funniest
  I've ever seen; I also read his earlier book - [Classic
  Scapes](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/james-acaster-s-classic-scrapes-the-hilarious-sunday-times-bestseller/9781472247193)
  - which I really enjoyed, so I was already primed to like this one. It's quite
  different from Classic Scrapes; it's much more personal and vulnerable, which
  I really enjoyed; and it has a huge list of interesting music, which is great
  if you're like me and struggle to think of new artists to listen to! Great
  reading.

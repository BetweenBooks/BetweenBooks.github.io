summary: |
  <p>I really enjoyed this one. I had heard about it for a while, and finally
  decided to pick it up after I saw it picked up a prize. My only regret
  is I waited so long! It's a really nice story, quirky and interesting
  and compellingly-written. I read this quite fast, and although it's
  short I wasn't left feeling like I wanted more, or anything was
  unexplained. Just a great book!</p>

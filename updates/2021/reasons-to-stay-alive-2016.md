summary: 
  I'm not sure how to feel about this. I read this *after* The Midnight
  Library (which I really really enjoyed), so perhaps that meant I had
  very high expectations. I think this book is probably good because of
  how personal it is, and how honest and open the author is about his life
  and his feelings. I think while I don't agree with everything in it (for
  example my view would be a bit more Buddhist than what the author says
  they are comfortable with), I do think it adds some useful thoughts to
  keep in mind when you're feeling depressed and hopeless.

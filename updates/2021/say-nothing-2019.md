summary: 
  Exciting read! This is the first book I read on The Troubles, and while
  it doesn't cover the much of the background or the start, it does cover
  one the period of time by following a few quite interesting characters.
  I particularly enjoyed learning about the process some academics covered
  in the story used in order to try and record the history and details of
  the troubles, and the associated difficulty of doing that. Very
  interesting!

summary: 
  I absolutely loved this book. I love semicolons and I use them all the
  time. But the important things I learned from this book was how
  malleable grammar used to be; and that people used to think of grammar
  as a form of self-expression, instead of a strict set of rules, as we
  consider it now. It's also written in a very fun and engaging way with
  plenty of jokes. The best book you're ever likely to read on grammar!

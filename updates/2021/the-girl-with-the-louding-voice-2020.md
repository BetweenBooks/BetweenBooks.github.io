summary: 
  I enjoyed this book. The development of the main character was
  interesting to read, and it certainly challenged me a bit because I
  would've preferred a story that had less problematic things happen to
  the character; or made her story of self-actualisation a bit more
  self-determined than luck; but it probably is more realistic as it is.
  Overall I think it nicely shows the difficulty faced by people in this
  position, and that was interesting to me to learn through this novel.
  Definitely recommend it!

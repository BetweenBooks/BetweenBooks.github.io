summary: 
  I loved Beowulf, by the same author; and this book promised to be a
  "modern" version of Beowulf. I have to say, I quite enjoyed it. I think
  I'm glad I read Beowulf by her *first*, as it gave me context for
  understanding this story. That said, I don't think that context is
  necessary; and this is a great read on it's own. If you could pick only
  one, I'd say read her version of Beowulf; but for a nice modern feminist
  retelling, you can't go wrong with this book!

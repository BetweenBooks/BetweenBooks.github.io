summary: | 
  Definitely a new favourite book. This one has a really nice, poetic,
  personal, engaging style and explores topics in economics through a very
  interesting lens: the mushroom. It presents lots of interesting
  conceptual discussions around commercial boundaries, what makes a
  product into something that can be sold, and has a nice journey into
  particular mushroom markets and what meaning they have for capitalism
  and communities in general. I wish more economics books were written in
  such a style! Certainly well worth reading if you're into challenging
  thoughts in this space!

summary: 
  I was really surprised and amazed by this book. I saw Ariel Levy talk at
  the amazing festival in Melbourne. I didn't know anything about her, but
  the image I did form didn't match what was revealed in this book. Very
  thought and captivating, and a relatable account of one persons life and
  dreams. Definitely recommended reading for an insight into a life that
  is quite different from my own.

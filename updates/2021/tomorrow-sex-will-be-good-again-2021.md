summary: 
  A thought-provoking analysis of the culture around consent and
  ability-to-know-ones feelings. Discusses the differences in how
  (heterosexual) sex and desire is talked about and researched. In
  particular the discussion centers around impersonal "objective"
  measurements of arousal and the conclusions from that; and what people
  can and should know about their desires; and how to manage expressing
  that to other people. Not conclusive; but a good contribution to a
  complex topic!

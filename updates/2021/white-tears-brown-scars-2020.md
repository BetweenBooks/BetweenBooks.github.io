summary: | 
  Definitely the best book on "white feminism" that I've ever read. This
  book has a particular focus on Australia, but is astonishingly good at
  gathering together different reactions to racism, in particular in the
  feminist community, and showing the impact that this has had on people
  of colour. What remains particularly memorable for me is how white
  people (of which I'm one) get particularly upset at being *called*
  racist, and how this can oftentimes trump actual experienced racism on
  the part of people of colour. Many terrible examples are recounted. Read
  this book now if you are at all interested in feminism and racism more
  generally; but be prepared, it is not easy reading. It's an amazing
  book.

summary: | 
  <p>This was, in my view, complete propaganda and a very bad book. Highly anti-recommend reading this. While it does contain some useful bits of information, and I'm sure is somewhat factual, it paints the fossil fuel industry in a bafflingly positive light. I had hoped to get some useful information about the science of carbon capture, and I don't feel that I did; certainly not in the form that I trust. Please, don't read this book :)</p>

summary: |
  <p>As a hopefully-one-day bookshop owner, I picked this up hoping for insights into the day-to-day operations of a bookshop. I didn't quite get that; I instead I was presented with the diary of what you might consider a classical grumpy, yet funny, mate who just happened to sell books. It's definitely an entertaining read, but probably not one I'd widely recommend. As a bit of trivia, the author lists the daily sales for each diary entry. I was curious enough to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e6cIYwJqOty4UIh_htSIqPISsRiWoGtfQELt63759TQ/edit?usp=sharing">take note of these on a spreadsheet</a>, if you too are curious of the raw revenue that could be expected from just book sales.</p>
  <p>Overall, I'm glad I read it, and while it doesn't contain much practical book-selling information or advice, it is an interesting slice of life!</p>

summary: | 
  <p>This book wasn't what I expected, but it was still quite interesting. It's seems to be me to be roughly a biography of this persons life in the social sector, but is also an exploration of a whole bunch of "alternative" programs that focus the particular communities, marginalised groups, and aim to find solutions from <em>within</em> those groups, rather than "fixing" them from the outside, with metrics and impact reports, etc. I think it's a great source of inspiration on that front, and has some relevance <a href="https://fixplanet.club/">for a project I'm part of</a> in the climate space. Definitely worth a glance!</p>

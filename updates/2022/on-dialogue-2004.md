summary: | 
  <p>Extremely relevant and interesting reading. It's a discussion of the very present problem of polarisation; i.e. how we can easily paint ourselves into corners from which we can't escape, or deem certain people irredeemable, and just generally avoid difficult conversations. I like Bohm a lot because of his connection to quantum physics, and Buddhism; so I'm very partial to this kind of topic. But this is a really great book, full of nice bits of insight; and it's short! I read it slowly, just to try and absorb as much as I could. Highly recommended!</p>

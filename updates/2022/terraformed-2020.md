summary: | 
  <p>This is a very interesting book. In part it's a discussion about gentrification, and what that looks like in a certain community; but it's also a discussion of racism, and the experiences of the black families.</p>
  <p>One thing that hit me particularly hard was the observation that must participation in the local neighbourhood revolves around <em>consumption</em>. What I found challenging was to imagine how else it could be. And in particular, made me thoughtful of how, if I were to open a physical bookshop (as is my dream), I could make space for participation that <em>doesn't</em> require consumption.</p>
  <p>In any case, I appreciated reading this for some interesting perspectives on how to think about urban planning and gentrification.</p>

summary: | 
  <p>I'm not sure how I feel about this book. I think it was certainly interesting to learn about her life, and what lead her to start her "Me Too" movement. That said, I can't say I could really relate at all to her experiences and choices. This makes it at least interesting and out of my comfort zone, but it also makes it hard to judge whether or not I enjoyed it, and what I got out of it. At least it let me build some empathy and understanding for how she's lived her life.</p>
  <p>Recommended reading for the history and backstory, and understanding what goes on the mind of someone with a totally different life experience from my own.</p>

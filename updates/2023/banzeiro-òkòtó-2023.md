summary: |
  <p>Absolutely extraordinary book. Extremely informative, powerful,
  emotional, inspiring, and poetic. I was struck at first by the amazing
  writing (which comes across really well in translation, I think, not
  that I've read the original ...), but stayed for the amazing
  story-telling and information about various illegal practices in
  Brazil.</p>
  <p>It's really an impressive piece of work, I can highly recommend it,
  but do note that it is also, in parts, quite traumatic. Still; one of
  those books that you feel sad when it ends; well worth reading!</p>

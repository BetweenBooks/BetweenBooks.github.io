summary: | 
  <p>Really a brilliant collection of insights and strong thoughts around
  feminism and it's connections to all aspects of society and life. The
  book is short but somehow packed with some much knowledge and beautiful
  connections to other works and writers/thinkers. Lola is a genius,
  really, of explaining practical ways to engage with feminism, and what
  it means for how we can engage it to bring about change. If you're ever
  at a loss for words when someone asks you "What is feminism?" then this
  book is for you!</p>

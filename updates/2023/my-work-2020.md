summary: | 
  <p>Really an exceptional piece of writing. A friend bought this for me,
  and at the time I didn't realise I had already read another of her
  books. This one is of a totally different character; basically telling
  the story of a woman's engagement with pregnancy, and the way society
  encourages it be handled. Being myself now a partner and a witness to
  this, I found it a very interesting perspective and helped me relate to
  the birth parent more. It's a stressful read, but an amazing one I
  think. Highly recommended!</p>

summary: | 
  <p>Amazing reading, ideas, and suggested actions for wildly revising how
  food is produced. I found this book particularly relevant because I have
  just started a new job that is in this space; but even otherwise it is a
  great, non-judgemental, and surprisingly inspiring, book about the
  climate crisis. It may even inspire you to start gardening :)</p>

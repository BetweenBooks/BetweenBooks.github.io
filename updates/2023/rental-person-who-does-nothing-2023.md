summary: | 
  <p>This was a strange one. I didn't know anything about this person or
  service, and I was expecting the book to be mostly funny. But it was
  actually far more serious and thoughtful than I had anticipated. I
  probably wouldn't recommend it to everyone; but it's at least refreshing
  for it's alternative take on what it means to live and relate to people.
  I also found it, I think, to be an interesting insight into some parts
  of modern Japanese culture. Quirky, for sure.</p>

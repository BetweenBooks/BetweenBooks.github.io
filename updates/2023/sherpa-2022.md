summary: | 
  <p>I learned a lot from this book. I quite enjoyed how it covered a
  variety of experiences of people from the Sherpa community, and it seems
  to me that it did a pretty fair job. It's certainly interesting to see
  how the Sherpa's view climbing. Worth a read for the stories and if
  you're interested in climbing culture and how and why the Sherpa's
  participate.</p>

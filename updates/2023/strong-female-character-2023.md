summary: |
  <p>Really quite interesting and good. I think I'd seen Fern Brady
  before, and she's clearly and interesting person, but this an
  enlightening book for me, in particular in building some empathy for how
  people with autism experience life and their emotions, and in particular
  women. Great reading!</p>

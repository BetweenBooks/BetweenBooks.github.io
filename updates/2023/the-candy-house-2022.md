summary: | 
  <p>An enjoyably rich read. I can't quite say what I got out of this
  other than simply the joy of reading. One thing I know for sure is that
  Egan is an amazing writer. I was reading this and another book, at the
  same time, and it was just incomparable how good her writing was ... in
  comparision :D. One memorable moment is that I read a lot of this book
  aloud, and the part where she writes as a teenager is just, for my mind,
  absolutely spot on. Anyway; highly recommend this one for some relaxing
  reading!</p>

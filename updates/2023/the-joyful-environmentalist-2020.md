summary: | 
  <p>I quite enjoyed this book; but it's probably not for everyone. Losada
  has an engaging and friendly style; extremely readable and enjoyable.
  The way she engages with the topic is pretty generous I think; perhaps
  the main criticism is that it's occasionally a bit too optimistic; but
  after all, that's basically what it promises on the cover! Overall, if
  you're looking for a bit of optimism and happiness, then take a glance!
  I'll definitely be trying to read more of her books :)</p>

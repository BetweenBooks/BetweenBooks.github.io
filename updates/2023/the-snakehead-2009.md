summary: | 
  <p>I picked this up because I've quite enjoyed his other books. This one
  was also pretty good; certainly compelling and readable. That said, it
  doesn't particularly challenge ideas about borders or immigration in any
  way that I would find agreeable. There's no doubt Keefe is a great
  story-teller, and I did enjoy reading this one, but you could be
  forgiven for passing it up for something else. That said, it did at
  least highlight to me <em>some</em> of the challenges building an
  effective immigration policy.</p>

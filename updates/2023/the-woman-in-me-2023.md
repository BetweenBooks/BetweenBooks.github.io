summary: | 
  <p>This was interesting and sad, truthfully. I've read a few of these
  "high-profile female celebrity" life books, and the common theme is just
  how much of a "normal" life they want, and how people around them betray
  them. I also think it's such a shame for people who's professional dream
  just happens to be one which makes them famous (not something that is
  likely to happen to me!), and then they suffer the consequences.</p>
  <p>Of course there is also the story of the conservatorship, which
  personally I can't begin to understand how it's legal.</p>
  <p>Overall, a very interesting and worthwhile read, and just a reminder,
  for me, of the importance of building self-empowerment in all children,
  and just the appreciation for a caring and supportive upbringing that I
  have had.</p>

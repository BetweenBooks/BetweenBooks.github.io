summary: |
  <p>Not bad; just not mind-blowing like the rest of her work. She's set
  an extremely high bar for her work, and while this series is good for
  anyone else, for me it was just a bit lacking the brilliance of her
  earlier ones. But it's a bit of an unfair comparison. Her first few
  books were, for me, just absolutely amazing, and this series didn't
  quite compare. It's still good, and worth reading all the way to the end
  of the acknowledgements for an alternative title. But if you were
  compelled to read only one of her works, you would start with literally
  any other series.</p>

summary: | 
  <p>I picked this up after watching and enjoying the show. The book is
  quite different; and it's interesting actually to compare it with the
  show; the team that converted the book into the show have done an
  impressive job, I think! I like both. I really couldn't put the book
  down. It has compellingly written and just interesting. A great read for
  those interested in the workings of organised crime (and journalism!) in
  Japan. I loved it!</p>

summary: | 
  <p>I loved this. I haven't read much art history, but this was a
  beautiful way to learn to appreciate art in the context in which it was
  made. Also contained some nice detours into architecture and urban
  planning that influenced the art/development of Venice. Will definitely
  try and read more like this in the future!</p>
